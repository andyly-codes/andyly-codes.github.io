At the time of writing, its been just over four months since coronavirus decided to visit the UK.</p>
<p>While it seems like things are returning to some degree of normality - social distance permitting - the influence of the pandemic has no doubt changed the way we live, work and interact in society.</p>
<p>Documenting these changes is the COVID Community Mobility Report, a dataset compiled and released by Google containing information on the movements of Android users who have turned on location history. Taking a break from writing my dissertation, I decided to draw up some data viz in R and dig around for any nuggets of interest.</p>

<h2 id="its-all-about-the-baseline" class="anchor-link"><a href="#its-all-about-the-baseline">It&rsquo;s all about the baseline</a></h2>
<p>There are 6 main categories in the dataset representing different venues and amenities. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>parks</li>
<li>retail and recreation</li>
<li>groceries and pharmacies</li>
<li>transport links</li>
<li>work places</li>
<li>residential</li>
</ul>
<p>The categories are quite broad and may not be so intuitive - for example, parks refer to national parks and not the general outdoors spaces in rural areas. Under their descriptions, visits to your local castle to test your eyesight is classified as a park visit too.</p>

<div class="box fancy-figure caption-position-bottom caption-effect-slide" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

    </div>
    <a href="/blog/covid_movement/excel.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>the raw data</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>Each category is given a numerical value for each day, representing the percentage change in visitors compared to the baseline. 
The baseline represents the median value for that day of the week during the periods of 3rd January to 6th February. 
The only different measurement is residential, which indicates the proportion of time people are spending at home compared to the baseline.</p>
<p>For clarity, I&rsquo;ve decided not to map work places and groceries and transport links in my graphs. The drop in people going to their workplace seems to overlap with the reduction in public transport use making the graph difficult to read, and the percentage of people going out to do their essential shopping was reduced but pretty constant throughout the four months.</p>

<h2 id="got-the-city-on-lockdown" class="anchor-link"><a href="#got-the-city-on-lockdown">Got the city on lockdown</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve earmarked some important dates in the timeline, which appear as horizontal dashed bars on the graphs. 
These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>20th March : Pubs, restaurants and cafes are ordered to close from end of service.</li>
<li>23rd March : Boris Johnson&rsquo;s televised announcement of lockdown - all non-essential businesses must close.</li>
<li>13th May: Restrictions on &lsquo;outdoor exercise&rsquo; is lifted.</li>
<li>1st June : People are able to leave home for any reason, up to 6 people can meet in public.</li>
<li>4th July : Further measures are eased - hospitality businesses re-open.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most dramatic shifts in movement behaviour is the interactions with park spaces. Given that people could only exercise in outdoor spaces during lockdown and were getting cabin fever from staying at home all day, this isn&rsquo;t all that suprising.</p>

<h3 id="west-yorkshire" class="anchor-link"><a href="#west-yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a></h3>


<div class="box fancy-figure caption-position-bottom caption-effect-slide" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/blog/covid_movement/wyorks.jpg" alt="West Yorkshire"/>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>West Yorkshire is where I&rsquo;m currently based so I wanted to see how we are behaving as a county. There is a steep rise in park visits soon after the one-hour outdoor exercise limit was eased, peaking on Spring Bank Holiday Monday when we were also blessed with good weather. While the park visits seem to follow a constant cycle, they don&rsquo;t really peak again, even with the hot weather over Summer. West Yorkshire is surrounded by several national parks - perhaps people are travelling further afield?</p>

<h3 id="dorset" class="anchor-link"><a href="#dorset">Dorset</a></h3>


<div class="box fancy-figure caption-position-bottom caption-effect-slide" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/blog/covid_movement/dorset.jpg" alt="Dorset"/>

      <figcaption>
          <p>Dorset</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>Dorset is the home to the beautiful New Forest national park and the seaside resort town of Bournemouth, which has featured heavily during news coverage on the BBC with scenes of beaches packed with people. During the Summer months total visits peak at +300% at almost every spike - these seem to agree with the situation with the heatwaves and swarms of people visiting beaches in Bournemouth. Interestingly, the data for the 31st July, the hottest day of the year, was missing.  There&rsquo;s also a little spike in park visitors just before lockdown started - a brief look in the news for the local area didn&rsquo;t unearth any events or particularly warm weather events, so not sure what happened (maybe a final dash of freedom before getting locked in..? :) ) By August 4th, levels of visitors to retail and recreation business visitors return to pre-Covid levels.</p>

<h3 id="cumbria" class="anchor-link"><a href="#cumbria">Cumbria</a></h3>

</div>

<p>Home of my favourite national park, the Lake District. 
Outdoor activity doesn&rsquo;t seem to pick up until the Spring Bank Holiday when a spike appears. Subsequent good weather through July increases Park visits by up to 200%, with the peak on the 31st July, the hottest day of 2020 so far. Interesting to note, visits to retail and recreation are almost back to pre-COVID levels, similar to Dorset. Perhaps this is driven by the influx of people visiting park areas?</p>

<h3 id="greater-london" class="anchor-link"><a href="#greater-london">Greater London</a></h3>


<div class="box fancy-figure caption-position-bottom caption-effect-slide" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/blog/covid_movement/London.jpg" alt="Greater London"/>

<p>The pattern in Park visitor changes looks most similar to the pattern in West Yorkshire - characterised by a gradual rise with the easing of outdoor exercise restrictions, followed by a constant pattern in the following weeks. It also seems the recovery of retail and recreation sector hasn&rsquo;t been as strong as the other regions.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts" class="anchor-link"><a href="#thoughts">Thoughts</a></h2>
<p>There seems to be a pattern between two types of areas - while park visitor changes display a relatively constant pattern in West Yorkshire and Greater London, Dorset and Cumbria see massive spikes in visits after lockdown measures are eased, coinciding with the recent good weather. The spikes in visitors also seem to also coincide with an uplift in retail and recreation spaces, returning to pre-COVID levels in these areas. Of course this is only speculative - it&rsquo;d be difficult to have confindence based on a sample of four obervations.</p>
<p>There are certain caveats with this dataset.</p>
<p>The baseline given is based on the median figures for the pre-COVID period between January and February this year. Therefore, you would naturally expect to see a spike in visitors parks during spells of good weather i.e. would we expect a 300% increase in total visitors in Summer compared to the winter months under normal circumstances? Ideally, we would compare the data with the same time period last year to see if the change is significant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this dataset is limited to Android users, and only those who have opted in to have their data collected. Given that the market share of Apple users is supposedly nearly 50% in the UK, it might be interesting to see if there is a difference between the distributions of Andriod and Apple users.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, the data provides fascinating insight into the behaviour of movement during a pandemic, and could help epidemiologists model how the virus can spread. I wonder how these might change in the coming months.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in creating a graph for yourself, the code is available on my github repository.</p>
